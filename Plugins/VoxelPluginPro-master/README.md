This code compiles on 4.24, 4.25, 4.26, 4.27 and Unreal 5.

## To install
Clone the full repo if you're familar with git, or download it as zip. Then follow **Installation**.

## Versions

You have access to two repos:
- https://gitlab.com/Phyronnaz/VoxelPluginPro
- https://gitlab.com/Phyronnaz/VoxelPluginProBeta

VoxelPluginProBeta is a mirror of my dev repo. It might not always compile - I don't recommend using it unless you're instructed to do so.
VoxelPluginPro is a build of VoxelPluginProBeta. This is the one you should use. Builds are pushed < 6h after a change lands in VoxelPluginProBeta.

If you wish to use a stable version (same as the marketplace releases), use https://gitlab.com/Phyronnaz/VoxelPluginPro/-/tree/Marketplace
