This is a legally binding agreement between licensee (“you”), and Voxel Plugin regarding your
rights to use the Voxel Plugin PRO Product under this license. “You” refers to the purchasing
entity, whether that is a natural person who must be at least 18 years of age, or a corporate

transferable to other parties so long it is in force and not terminated, otherwise violated, or
extinguished, as set forth herein.  The terms of the license are as follows:
